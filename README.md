Challenge for accessibility website

My motivation is to be able to make more accessible websites; increase the exposure on google searches to increase business leads and sales.I recieved a ticket that there were bugs in the website that needed refactoring. So that the links work properly and make more accessible for end users.Solved issues by adding title change and and changing all divs in the website to being more accessible and making the code easier to read. I learned how to do semantec elements, the meaning and the purpose of how they are viewed.
